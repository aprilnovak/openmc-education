    "## TRISO Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC includes a few convenience functions for generating locations of randomly packed spheres that can be used to model TRISO particles and/or pebbles in a reactor core. To be clear, this capability is not a stochastic geometry capability like that included in MCNP. It's also important to note that OpenMC does not use delta tracking, which would normally speed up calculations in geometries with tons of surfaces and cells. However, the computational burden can be eased by placing random spheres in a lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability relies on three functions/classes:\n",
    "- `openmc.model.pack_spheres` -- generate locations of random spheres\n",
    "- `openmc.model.TRISO` -- Cell-like object that holds a universe storing the internal structure of a pebble/TRISO\n",
    "- `openmc.model.create_triso_lattice` -- Creates a lattice containing `TRISO` objects for improved tracking performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the `pack_spheres` function. This function takes an outer radius of the spheres, a containing region, and a packing fraction and will return an array of sphere coordinates. For our example, let's use spheres with a radius of 1 cm and a packing fraction of 30%. We'll put our spheres inside of a finite cylinder."
