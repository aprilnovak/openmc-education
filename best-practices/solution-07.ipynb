In all k-eigenvalue cases, you don't know the source distribution, so whatever choice you make is a GUESS.

    "For the central limit theorm to apply, each batch of particles which is used to assembly a tally realization should be INDEPENDENT. However, this is obviously not the case, since we sample the birth sites for neutrons in batch $i$ from the the fission sites from batch $i-1$. This is called \"inter-cycle correlation,\" and means that the actual variances reported by a Monte Carlo code *underpredict* the true variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that you can increase the independence of batches is to set `settings.generations_per_batch` to a number greater than 1. This will effectively increase the independence of each batch by reduce the cross-correlation between the fission bank of other batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can quantify the extent of inter-cycle correlation by running OpenMC repeated times using different seeds. The mean and standard deviation of those estimates have the inter-cycle correlation removed. In order for these runs to be faster, we can drastically reduce the number of inactive batches (of course, our answers are wrong, but right now we are only exploring the inter-cycle correlation aspect, which is independent of the inactive batch choice)."
