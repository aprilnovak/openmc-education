OpenMC's C-API allows you to interact with an OpenMC simulation in-memory by changing cell temperatures and densities, adding/removing tallies, and much more - all without re-initializing OpenMC between multiphysics feedback steps."

OpenMC will send a volumetric heat source to the thermal-fluids solver, which will use this heat source to compute temperatures and densities that will be sent back to OpenMC. The two physics (OpenMC, thermal-fluids) will then be iterated several times in-memory.\n",
    "We will divide the problem into $N$ axial cells in both OpenMC and the T/H app, with coupling between layer $i$ in OpenMC and layer $i$ in the T/H app. We will not couple solid _density_ to this problem because to properly conserve the fissile mass, this would require re-generation of the geometry (i.e. larger or smaller pin radii) with each coupled physics iteration. \n",

    "### How OpenMC Uses Temperature\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Set a default temperature, using `settings.temperature['default']`\n",
    "2. Set the temperature of an `openmc.Material`\n",
    "3. Set the temperature of an `openmc.Cell`\n",
    "4. Read temperature from a superimposed mesh (coming soon)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order of precedence, OpenMC attempts to find temperatures from the bottom of the list, going to the top. For example, in our multiphysics calculation we can use `settings.temperature['default']` to easily set a uniform initial temperature for the entire domain. But when we want to set a spatially-dependent temperature, we'll set those temperatures using the cell objects. We could have used the material approach, but this would require us to create copies of the materials for each location they appear in the model, which for large problems can be memory intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperatures Not in the LIbrary\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to set the method by which OpenMC determines which cross sections to read if a corresponding library is not available on your machine. For example, you may want to change the fuel to 725 K, but only have libraries at 600 K and 900 K. There are two available methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `interpolation`, which means that if a cell is at temperature $T$, that the microscopic cross section is evaluated based on a stochastic interpolation between the cross sections at $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$, where $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$ are the temperatures that bound $T$ for which cross section data is loaded.\n",
    "- `nearest`, which will select the closest available library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to be sure to load cross section data over a fairly wide range in temperatures - we're not sure exactly how hot the fuel is going to be for the coupled case until we run it! So we can set a `range` from 294 K to something high - say, 3000 K. This should hopefully cover all the temperatures we encounter in our coupled run. This is necessary because OpenMC will load all the cross sections into memory at the start of the run (for performance reasons, we don't check each time a collision occurs that the library contains the relevant data needed at that temperature - we simply move straight to evaluating).\n",
