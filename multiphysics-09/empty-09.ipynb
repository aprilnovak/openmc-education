We require separate cells so that OpenMC can apply a histogram-type resolution for temperature and density feedback.\n",

Once we've found the cell, then we can call `set_temperature` for that cell to apply the temperature from our thermal-fluids app.\n",

Finally, we call the `set_density` function for that material to apply the density from our thermal-fluids app."
