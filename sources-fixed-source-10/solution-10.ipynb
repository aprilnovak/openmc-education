    "# Defining an External Source\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, if you do not specify the initial source distribution, OpenMC considers a point source (at the origin) with an isotropic angular distribution and the Watt fission spectrum. Regardless of the source distribution, OpenMC will randomly sample from the distribution and \"accept\" the particle for transport if it is within the confines of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For criticality problems, any initial source distribution is fine, provided you have a source rejection rate above 95% (i.e. at least 5% of your attempts to sample a neutron are successful, meaning that you're not automatically sampling a neutron outside the domain of the problem) - you'll still need to be sure to run enough inactive batches to converge away from this guessed source, so choosing a more physically realistic source could help you to run overall fewer inactive batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course for a fixed source calculation, you will always be defining a source distribution corresponding to the known neutron/photon source of your problem (unless your starting source really is an isotropic point source at the origin of U235 fission neutrons!).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC provides several options for defining an external source definition. There are currently four primary classes for defining a source:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `openmc.IndependentSource`\n",
    "- `openmc.FileSource`\n",
    "- `openmc.MeshSource`\n",
    "- `openmc.CompiledSource`\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll briefly go through each of these classes with the exception of `CompiledSource`, which is a bit more involved as it requires compiling a source class written in C++. `CompiledSource` is typically used when the source definition does not fit cleanly in any of the other formalisms; common examples here would be the neutron source in a tokamak or stellarator, or a beam-target source with a complex angle-energy distribution."

    "Let's now demonstrate how to write a surface source with OpenMC, which you may use to then run a second OpenMC calculation starting from those source particles. For example, this could be used to find the surface source on the outside of a reactor (with vacuum outside) using a k-eigenvalue calculation, to then load this source into a second fixed source calculation only considering the shielding outside the reactor. Of course, this example is an approximation to the integrated problem when both domains are present - but this notion of splitting a domain into separate runs is often used for experiment analysis.\n",

    "Let's record all the particles which cross from the aluminum into the fuel. To do so, we'll set a dictionary named `surf_source_write` in the settings. The particles added to the surface source will simply be added starting from the active batches, until reaching the desired number per rank."
